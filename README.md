This application can load the map from any PixARK world and show a lot more details than the in game map, like surface ores and extra biomes, and it also has full resolution (1 pixel per block).

If you can't load any map, locate your PixARK save folder and try to find a folder called "CubeWorld_Light" inside of it, then copy it's full path and paste it in the top text box of the application and press "Enter", if done correct now you should see a map loading after a few seconds.

Your worlds will always be loaded as read-only, so they will never be modified in any way by this application, which also means that you can quickly see the full map of any world, even if you don't use the cheat to reveal the map or you haven't explored the full world yet, once you see the several markers to spawn in a new world and even with PixARK started you can already load that world in this application without risk.

At the bottom right corner you'll see a world analysis text based on the currently loaded world, that analysis was inspired by the PixARK wiki page about the interesting map seeds found by the community, so this might help you post your seed findings onto that page if you want, and also quickly see in detail if a newly created world might be what you were looking for or you need to create a new one.

So far in a few dozens of newly created worlds I've never found the biomes "12" and "19", so perhaps they are related to some boss fights, etc. For now I don't know it's contents or if they even exist at all.

I've only tested this application with one version of PixARK, and although I believe it should work for most, it might be that a future update stops this application from working as intented, so if you find any bug, please post a comment on GitHub or send me an e-mail from the main context menu and I'll fix it as soon as I can. Thank you for you collaboration.
